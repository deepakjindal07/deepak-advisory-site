    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a lifelong learner and student of financial markets, with over a decade of personal investing experience. My focus is on researching businesses, understanding market psychology, and sharing educational insights that simplify investing concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this platform, I aim to share structured learning modules that help individuals build their own understanding of stock markets, risk, valuation, and investor behavior.
