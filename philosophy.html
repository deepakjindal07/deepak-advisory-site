  <h2>Our Investment Philosophy</h2>
  <p>Built on timeless principles, proven strategies, and the wisdom of legendary investors</p>
</div>

<div class="container">
  
  <!-- Introduction -->
  <div class="intro-section">
    <p>
      Our investment philosophy is deeply rooted in <strong>value investing</strong>, long-term thinking, 
      and the fundamental belief that exceptional businesses, acquired at reasonable valuations, generate 
      wealth through the powerful force of compounding. We firmly believe that markets reward patience, 
      discipline, and analytical clarity far more than speculation or market timing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the years, we have studied and internalized the wisdom of legendary investors—<strong>Warren Buffett, 
      Charlie Munger, Peter Lynch, Benjamin Graham, Philip Fisher, and Mohnish Pabrai</strong>—adapting their 
      timeless insights to the dynamic landscape of Indian equity markets. These principles have not only 
      guided our research methodology but have fundamentally shaped how we analyze businesses and construct 
      investment frameworks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our approach rejects the noise of daily market movements and short-term speculation. Instead, we focus 
      on understanding business fundamentals, competitive advantages, management quality, and long-term value 
      creation. This philosophy has consistently helped us identify companies that deliver sustainable growth 
      and meaningful returns over extended periods.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Core Principles -->
  <div class="principles-section">
    <h3>Core Investment Principles</h3>
    
    <div class="principle-grid">
      
      <div class="principle-card">
        <span class="principle-icon">🏰</span>
        <h4>Economic Moats & Competitive Advantages</h4>
        <p>
          We seek businesses with durable competitive moats—strong brands, network effects, cost advantages, 
          or regulatory barriers that protect them from competition and enable sustained profitability over decades.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-card">
        <span class="principle-icon">📊</span>
        <h4>Fundamental Analysis First</h4>
        <p>
          Deep analysis of cash flow generation, return on capital employed, margin stability, balance sheet 
          strength, and long-term demand trends forms the foundation of our research process.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-card">
        <span class="principle-icon">👔</span>
        <h4>Management Quality & Capital Allocation</h4>
        <p>
          Exceptional CEOs are exceptional capital allocators. We study how management deploys profits—through 
          reinvestment, acquisitions, dividends, or buybacks—as this determines long-term shareholder value.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-card">
        <span class="principle-icon">📈</span>
        <h4>Margin of Safety</h4>
        <p>
          Following Benjamin Graham's principle, we always seek a significant gap between price and intrinsic 
          value, providing protection against errors in judgment and unforeseen market volatility.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-card">
        <span class="principle-icon">🔄</span>
        <h4>Understanding Market Cycles</h4>
        <p>
          Market history doesn't repeat exactly, but it rhymes. Understanding economic and business cycles 
          helps us maintain discipline during euphoria and courage during panic.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-card">
        <span class="principle-icon">🧠</span>
        <h4>Independent Thinking</h4>
        <p>
          We think from first principles rather than following market sentiment or media narratives. True 
          value emerges from contrarian analysis backed by thorough research.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-card">
        <span class="principle-icon">⏳</span>
        <h4>Time as the Ultimate Advantage</h4>
        <p>
          We believe in giving quality businesses time to compound. The real wealth is created not through 
          trading but through patient ownership of outstanding companies.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-card">
        <span class="principle-icon">🎯</span>
        <h4>Concentrated Conviction</h4>
        <p>
          Rather than over-diversifying, we believe in owning fewer, high-quality businesses that we understand 
          deeply—putting meaningful capital behind our best ideas.
        </p>
      </div>

    </div>

  <!-- Wisdom from Masters -->
  <div class="quotes-section">
    <h3>Wisdom From Investment Legends</h3>
    
    <div class="quote-container">
      
      <div class="quote-card">
        <div class="quote-text">
          "Price is what you pay. Value is what you get."
        </div>
        <div class="quote-author">— Warren Buffett</div>
        <div class="quote-explanation">
          This fundamental distinction between price and value has shaped our entire valuation approach. 
          We focus not on short-term price movements, but on the underlying intrinsic worth of a business. 
          Markets can misprice securities in the short run, but eventually, value and price converge. Our 
          job is to identify this gap and wait patiently for the market to recognize true value.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="quote-card">
        <div class="quote-text">
          "Know what you own, and know why you own it."
        </div>
        <div class="quote-author">— Peter Lynch</div>
        <div class="quote-explanation">
          Peter Lynch's wisdom taught us that successful investing requires clarity and conviction. If we 
          cannot explain a business model in simple terms or articulate why we own a stock, we avoid it. 
          This principle keeps us focused on businesses we truly understand rather than chasing complex 
          opportunities or following the crowd.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="quote-card">
        <div class="quote-text">
          "The big money is not in the buying or the selling, but in the waiting."
        </div>
        <div class="quote-author">— Charlie Munger</div>
        <div class="quote-explanation">
          This reinforces the critical importance of patience and the compounding effect that only long-term 
          investing unlocks. The greatest returns come from holding exceptional businesses through market 
          cycles, allowing time and compound growth to work their magic. Trading frequently disrupts this 
          powerful process.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="quote-card">
        <div class="quote-text">
          "In the short run, the market is a voting machine. In the long run, it's a weighing machine."
        </div>
        <div class="quote-author">— Benjamin Graham</div>
        <div class="quote-explanation">
          Graham's insight reminds us that short-term prices reflect sentiment and emotion, while long-term 
          prices reflect fundamental business performance. This distinction allows us to remain calm during 
          market volatility and focus on what truly matters—the underlying business quality and earnings power.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="quote-card">
        <div class="quote-text">
          "The stock market is designed to transfer money from the Active to the Patient."
        </div>
        <div class="quote-author">— Warren Buffett</div>
        <div class="quote-explanation">
          This powerful observation validates our long-term approach. Frequent trading, market timing, and 
          chasing momentum typically destroy value through transaction costs, taxes, and poor timing. Patient, 
          buy-and-hold investing in quality businesses has consistently outperformed active trading strategies.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="quote-card">
        <div class="quote-text">
          "Heads I win, Tails I don't lose much."
        </div>
        <div class="quote-author">— Mohnish Pabrai</div>
        <div class="quote-explanation">
          Pabrai's framework for asymmetric risk-reward is central to our investment selection. We seek 
          opportunities where the potential upside significantly exceeds the downside risk. Combined with 
          margin of safety, this approach protects capital while positioning for substantial gains.

    <p>
      We don't believe in shortcuts, hot tips, or market predictions—only in rigorous research, patient 
      execution, and intelligent capital allocation. Great wealth is built slowly, methodically, and with 
      unwavering discipline. It's not exciting or glamorous, but it works consistently over time.
